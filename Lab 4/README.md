### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 3 ways you can do so:


Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.
```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2026
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

---

### Quick Start: Python Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment in Lab 4:**
	```bash
	cd ~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 4
	python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```
2. **Install all Lab 4 requirements:**
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements2025.txt
	```
3. **Check CircuitPython Blinka installation:**
	```bash
	python blinkatest.py
	```
	If you see "Hello blinka!", your setup is correct. If not, follow the troubleshooting steps in the file or ask for help.

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
 
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). Install the latest requirements from your working virtual environment:

These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

> I connected the MPR121 through Qwiic and tested the touch pads directly. I then connected an alligator lead to pad 0 and touched the exposed metal at the other end. The terminal detected touch and release events on channel 0.
>
> In the alligator-clip test, three clear touches lasted approximately 2.77, 2.35, and 4.58 seconds. There were also additional events during the test. After the final release, no new events appeared for approximately 60 seconds, and no other channels triggered. An earlier direct-pad test had short repeated events and one unusually long touch reading, so I have not yet established the cause of those readings.
>
> This test used the exposed metal of the alligator clip; I have not yet tested a separate food or foil object.

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>
 

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

> I replaced the MPR121 with the APDS-9960 using the Qwiic connection. In a 20-second proximity test, the raw readings ranged from 0 to 239. These are raw proximity values, not distances in centimeters.
>
> A separate 20-second light/color check returned 19 RGB and clear-channel samples. The clear-channel readings ranged from 39 to 10,949 during the shading exercise. This confirms changing light readings and working RGB data retrieval; it does not establish accurate color recognition.
>
> Neither the first 20-second gesture check nor a separate 30-second check returned any direction events. Gesture recognition remains unverified. I have not established whether the cause is the motion, sensor placement, or configuration.

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder 

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came pre-soldered, so you do NOT need to solder anything.
<p float="left">

   
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/377-02.jpg" height="200" />
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4991-09.jpg" height="200">
</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script, it comes with an additional button which might be useful for your design!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python encoder_test.py
```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

> The encoder was detected at address 0x36 with product ID 4991. The first check verified communication and sent red, green, and blue commands to the board's NeoPixel, then turned it off. I visually confirmed all three colors. The LED check used seesaw pin 6, following the linked Adafruit example.
>
> A separate 25-second input check recorded the position increasing from 0 to 75 and then decreasing to 61 when the rotation was reversed. It also recorded two complete button presses and releases. These results confirm rotation in both directions, the pushbutton, and visible LED output.

#### Joystick 


A [joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) can be used to sense and report the input of the stick for it pivoting angle or direction. It also comes with a button input!

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/3/5/5/8/15168-SparkFun_Qwiic_Joystick-01.jpg" height="200" />
</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script to see what it can do!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python joystick_test.py
```

> I connected the Qwiic joystick and checked both axes and its pushbutton. The detected firmware version was v2.6. During a 45-second check, both X and Y ranged from 0 to 1023, and the stick returned to approximately X=508, Y=510 after the directional inputs.
>
> The first check contained no button changes. A separate 20-second button check recorded 1 → 0 → 1, confirming one complete press and release: 0 was pressed and 1 was released.

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick_Py) to learn more about the sensor!

#### Distance Sensor


Earlier we have asked you to play with the proximity sensor, which is able to sense objects within a short distance. Here, we offer [Sparkfun Proximity Sensor Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15177), With the ability to detect objects up to 20cm away.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/3/5/9/2/15177-SparkFun_Proximity_Sensor_Breakout_-_20cm__VCNL4040__Qwiic_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script to see how it works!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python qwiic_distance.py
```

> I connected the VCNL4040 and ran a 25-second proximity check. The 63 readings ranged from 0 to 20,869, with repeated high-to-low changes during the near/far exercise. Several low periods were around 3–4, and the final reading was 3.
>
> The test confirms a changing proximity signal suitable for exploring object-presence detection. These are raw readings, not calibrated distances. A threshold for the final interaction still needs to be chosen using the actual object and sensor placement.

### Part C
### Servo Actuation

Now that you have explored several forms of sensing, add physical output by learning to control a servo motor. Complete the Servo pHAT setup and basic servo test before beginning your interaction design.

### Servo Control with SparkFun Servo pHAT
For this lab, you will use the **SparkFun Servo pHAT** to control a micro servo (such as the Miuzei MS18 or similar 9g servo). The Servo pHAT stacks directly on top of the Adafruit Mini PiTFT (135×240) display without pin conflicts:
- The Mini PiTFT uses SPI (GPIO22, 23, 24, 25) for display and buttons ([SPI pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/spi)).
- The Servo pHAT uses I²C (GPIO2 & 3) for the PCA9685 servo driver ([I2C pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)).
- Since SPI and I²C are separate buses, you can use both boards together.
**⚡ Power:**
- Plug a USB-C cable into the Servo pHAT to provide enough current for the servos. The Pi itself should still be powered by its own USB-C supply. Do NOT power servos from the Pi’s 5V rail.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Servo_pHAT.gif" alt="Servo pHAT Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

**Basic Python Example:**
We provide a simple example script: `Lab 4/pi_servo_hat_test.py` (requires the `pi_servo_hat` Python package).
Run the example:
```
python pi_servo_hat_test.py
```
For more details and advanced usage, see the [official SparkFun Servo pHAT documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pi-servo-phat-v2-hookup-guide/all#resources-and-going-further).

> I checked the SIG, 5V, and GND connections and attempted an unloaded, finite channel-0 test using [servo_center_test.py](servo_center_test.py). The test sends two short sequences around the center pulse, using approximately 1.417–1.583 ms pulses, and finishes at 1.5 ms.
>
> The channel-0 commands completed, and the controller registers matched the intended center configuration. However, I observed no servo movement, including on a repeat run.
>
> I then moved the same servo to channel 1 and repeated the same short test using `python servo_center_test.py --channel 1`. The servo moved back and forth normally and returned to center. This verifies basic unloaded actuation on channel 1. The reason for the channel-0 failure is still unresolved; I have not established whether it was contact, wiring, or a channel fault. Future integration will use channel 1.

A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. The position is set by the width of an electrical pulse (PWM). You can read [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn more about how servos work.

### Part D
### Physical Interaction Design: Feast Automata

**Feast Automata:** build a device that **transforms ordinary dining rituals into playful physical interactions.** Begin with a familiar experience around eating, drinking, cooking, serving, or sharing food, and explore how sensing and actuation might augment, exaggerate, automate, or reinterpret your dining experience.

In this part, use the sensing techniques from Parts A–B and the servo actuation from Part C to develop a physical interaction.

#### Physical considerations for sensing

Sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for an application. Choose a sensor that fits the dining interaction you want to explore. For example, a distance sensor could detect when a cup is placed on a coaster; where the sensor is positioned determines what it can reliably detect.

Think about how the larger object needs to be shaped so the sensor can work reliably, where the actuator needs to sit, what moves, and how a person encounters the interaction.

#### Physical Form and Housing

Think about how your sensor, actuator, and electronics are physically arranged within your prototype. Consider where components need to be placed, what parts move, how the device is supported or enclosed, and how the overall form and aesthetics shape the interaction.

Use cardboard, paper, found objects, or other low-fidelity materials to quickly prototype the physical structure before refining your final design.

#### Optional Display Feedback: Qwiic OLED

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>


As you develop your Feast Automata concept, consider where the sensor and actuator need to be placed, what parts move, how electronics are housed, and how the overall form and aesthetics support the interaction.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches that explore different physical arrangements for your sensing and actuation.\*\*\***

> ![Five Feast Automata sketches: over-pour head shaker, sugar cube dropper, cheers buddy, snack guard, condiment passer cart](images/feast_sketches.svg)

> 1. A figure that will shake it head if you pour too much drink into the glass. Sensor: Copper tape strips up the outside of the glass connected to capacitive sensor. Movement: The figure's neck, shaking its head. 
> 2. A sugar cube dropper that drops a sugar cube into the cup when the cup is detected. Sensor: distance sensor inside the coaster notices when the cup is put down. Movement: a servo opens a gate at the bottom of a hopper of sugar cubes, so one cube slides down a chute into the cup.
> 3. Cheers buddy. Sensor: the distance sensor in a coaster notices when the cup is lifted, as in the Windmill Coaster example.
Movement: a servo in the figure's shoulder raises its arm and a small cardboard glass, then lowers it when you put the cup down.
> 4. Snack guard. Sensor: the proximity/gesture sensor (APDS-9960) at the rim of the bowl counts each time a hand reaches in.
Movement: after the third reach, a servo swings a "stop" arm or lid over the bowl for a few seconds.
> 5. Condiment passer wheel carts. Sensor: the joystick to control which condiment and the movement direction of the wheel carts. Movement: the joystick remotely controls the wheel carts to move the condiment across the table.

**\*\*\*What questions do these sketches raise? What do you need to physically prototype to answer them?\*\*\***

> 1. How would the sensor sense through the glass/bottle for the water level? Can the glass still be picked up and drunk from with wires attached? -> Need to build a mock-up with wire in place to test out the feasibility.
> 2. Can the servo gate release exactly one sugar cube at a time without jamming, and will the cube land in the cup instead of bouncing out? -> Need to build the hopper and chute and test with real sugar cubes at different chute angles.
> 3. Will the movement intervine with user's action to pick up/put down the cup? -> Need to see if the design can be spacious enough and happen on time to make the "cheers" discoverable.
> 4. Does the rim sensor count one reach as one, or does it double-count the hand going in and coming out? -> Need to test out that in action and fine-tune when will it count.
> 5. Do the bottles stay upright when it starts and stops? → Load the cart with real weight and test it out.

**\*\*\*Pick one design to prototype and explain why.\*\*\***

> We picked design 2, the sugar cube dropper. It has the clearest sense → act loop (cup goes down, sugar goes in), it only needs one sensor and one servo, and it raised the most physical questions to answer with cardboard: how cubes are held, released, and guided into the cup.
>
> **Pivot: from a gate to a rotating wheel.** In the sketch, a servo opened a gate under the hopper so a cube could slide out. Once we started building it, a gate looked hard to control. How many cubes fall depends on how long the gate stays open and how the cubes are stacked, so it could release zero, one, or several at once, and cubes could jam half-way through. We switched to a rotating wheel instead: a cardboard cross mounted on the servo horn divides the space under the hopper into four pockets. Each pocket holds one cube, and each 90° turn of the servo carries one pocket from the hopper to the chute and drops its cube. This is easier to control with the servo, since we just send it to fixed angles instead of timing an open/close, and it makes the dose easy to set: one turn for one cube, two turns for two.
>
> One limitation: our servo (Miuzei MS18 micro servo) only rotates 0–180°, not continuously. So the wheel can step 0° → 90° → 180° to drop up to two cubes, then has to swing back to 0° to reset before the next round. We still need to test whether the pockets pick up or drop extra cubes on the way back, and whether the micro servo has enough torque to push the wheel through a full hopper without stalling.

Build a cardboard or other low-fidelity physical prototype of your design.

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype with photos and/or video.\*\*\***

## Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

---

### Part E

#### Build & Integrate: Sensing + Actuation

For Part 2, build the Feast Automata interaction you developed in Part D by connecting sensing/input to physical actuation.

**Your prototype should:**
- Use at least one sensing or input device.
- Use servo-based physical actuation.
- Connect sensing and actuation into a meaningful interaction around eating, drinking, cooking, serving, or sharing food.
- Additional inputs, displays, LEDs, buttons, or other outputs are optional extensions.

**Document your system with:**
- Code for your sensing + actuation prototype
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how sensing and actuation are connected
- Written reflection: What did you learn about connecting sensing, movement, and physical form? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**
- How does your chosen sensor or input shape the physical response?
- How does the physical arrangement of the sensor and actuator change the interaction?
- What thresholds, timing, or movement patterns make the interaction feel clear or playful?
- What changes when you adjust the sensor placement or servo motion?

Iterate on the sensing, movement, and physical form, and document what you discover.

#### Our Integrated Prototype: Joystick Sugar Cube Dropper

Our final prototype replaces the original cup-detection input with a deliberate joystick gesture. The user rotates the joystick through one complete circle. The program reads both the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes to determine whether the joystick has traveled around the center. After a complete circle is recognized, the servo rotates the sugar-cube wheel by 180 degrees, allowing one sugar cube to fall into the chute. The system then waits for the joystick to return to its neutral center before it can trigger again. This re-arming step prevents one gesture from accidentally dispensing multiple cubes.

| Stage | Input or state | Physical response |
|---|---|---|
| Ready | Joystick is at its neutral center | The rotator waits at its resting position |
| Gesture | User moves the joystick in a full circle | The program tracks both X and Y axes |
| Dispense | A complete circle is recognized | The servo turns the rotator 180 degrees |
| Delivery | A rotator pocket reaches the chute | One sugar cube drops |
| Re-arm | User releases the joystick back to center | The system becomes ready for the next gesture |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Rotate joystick in a full circle] --> B[Track X and Y movement]
    B --> C{Complete circle detected?}
    C -- No --> B
    C -- Yes --> D[Rotate servo 180 degrees]
    D --> E[Drop one sugar cube]
    E --> F[Wait for joystick center]
    F --> A
```

The circular gesture makes dispensing intentional and playful: the user performs a motion before receiving a cube instead of simply pressing a button. Reading both axes is essential because either axis alone would only show back-and-forth movement and could not distinguish a circular gesture. The neutral-center requirement also creates a clear end to each interaction cycle.

#### Code

> **Placeholder — final tested implementation:** Add the working joystick-and-servo Python file and link its filename here.

#### Working Prototype Evidence

> **Video:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h8bf5-Ks-bC1W4nmB9jm69nvbywwYkT4/view?usp=drive_link

#### Written Reflection

> **Placeholder for the team’s observations after the final code.** Replace the prompts below with the results observed during the working prototype test:
>
> - What method did the final code use to recognize a complete circle from the X and Y readings?
> - Which joystick thresholds or center range worked reliably?
> - How long did the 180-degree servo movement take, and did it consistently release exactly one cube?
> - What changes to the rotator, hopper, or chute improved reliability?
> - What was fun, surprising, or challenging when sensing, movement, and physical form were combined?
> - What would the team change in the next iteration?

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an optional example of chaining together three devices.

**`Lab 4/encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py`**

#### Example Application: Windmill Coaster

Now that you have explored both sensing and actuation, here is a simple example that combines the two.

The **Windmill Coaster** uses a Qwiic distance/proximity sensor to detect when a cup is placed on a coaster. When the cup is detected, a servo motor animates a small windmill by sweeping it back and forth, turning an ordinary action during drinking into a playful physical interaction.

<p align="center">
    <img src="windmill_coaster11.gif" alt="Windmill Coaster Demo" width="400"/>
</p>


This example demonstrates a simple interaction pipeline:

**cup placed → distance sensor detects cup → servo actuates windmill**

Connect the Qwiic distance sensor to the Pi and connect the servo to Channel 0 of the Servo pHAT. Make sure the Servo pHAT is powered through its USB-C connection.

Run the example script:

```bash
python windmill_coaster.py
```

The script continuously reads the proximity value from the distance sensor. When the value passes a threshold, the servo begins animating the windmill. When the cup is removed, the servo stops and returns to its resting position.

You may need to adjust `CUP_THRESHOLD` in [`windmill_coaster.py`](windmill_coaster.py) depending on the size of your cup and the physical placement of the sensor. You can run `qwiic_distance.py` first to compare readings with and without a cup.

Use this example as a starting point. Change the sensor, movement, physical form, or dining interaction to create your own Feast Automata variation.

#### Optional Extensions

The following examples are optional resources if you want to add more inputs or outputs to your prototype.

##### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | Address (hex) |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x6F       |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |    0x6E       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |    0x6D       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |    0x6C       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |    0x6B       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |    0x6A       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |    0x69       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |    0x68       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x67       |
| ...| ...| ...| ... |     ...      |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**
- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```
Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!


##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_1_button.py
	```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
	```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:
```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

##### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**
- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

<p align="center">
    <img src="gpio_leds.gif" alt="GPIO Expander LED Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:
- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:
```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.

### Part F

### Final Documentation

#### Sugar Cube Dropper: Final Interaction

The Sugar Cube Dropper turns serving sugar into a small physical ritual. Instead of pressing a normal dispenser button, the user draws a circle with a joystick. The Raspberry Pi interprets the two-axis gesture and commands a servo-driven rotator to move 180 degrees. This moves one sugar cube to the chute. The user then releases the joystick to its center position, resetting the interaction for the next serving.

#### Looks Like

The final prototype is a sugar cube dispenser with a black 3D-printed housing. The upper section stores sugar cubes, while a servo-driven rotator controls their release through the bottom outlet into a cup placed below. The open front exposes the internal mechanism, making its movement visible to the user.

The Raspberry Pi and Servo pHAT sit beside the dispenser, with a separate joystick providing the input. During testing, the housing is positioned at the edge of the table so that a cup can sit beneath the outlet. The printed structure holds the storage compartment and rotating mechanism in alignment, developing the earlier cardboard prototype into a more integrated physical form.

#### Design Iterations

We first explored the dispensing mechanism through cardboard prototypes, then used CAD to develop the housing, hopper, and servo placement before building the 3D-printed version.

![Initial CAD design](image-3.png)

The initial CAD study shows the dispenser mounted on a backboard, with a base positioning the cup beneath the outlet. The open front reveals how the storage compartment, rotating wheel, and outlet fit together.

![Revised hopper and servo placement](image-4.png)

A later CAD study explores a sloped hopper wall to guide cubes toward the rotating mechanism and a side-mounted servo to drive the wheel. These images document design explorations; the final printed prototype uses the cylindrical rotator shown in the component photograph above.

**Video:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h8bf5-Ks-bC1W4nmB9jm69nvbywwYkT4/view?usp=drive_link

#### Works Like

The device operates as a state-based sensing-and-actuation system:

1. It waits while the joystick is centered.
2. It reads both joystick axes as the user traces a circle.
3. It confirms that a full circular gesture has been completed.
4. It commands the servo to rotate the dispenser by 180 degrees.
5. The rotator carries one sugar cube to the chute, where it drops toward the cup.
6. It does not accept another gesture until the joystick returns to its neutral center.

The X and Y readings together describe movement around the joystick’s center. The center-return condition separates consecutive servings and reduces accidental repeated activation.

#### Acts Like

The user places a cup under the chute, takes hold of the joystick, and rotates it once around its full range. Completing the circle feels like winding or operating a small food machine. The rotator responds by turning and dispensing one cube. The user releases the joystick so it returns to center, providing a visible and physical ending before another cube can be requested.

| Prototype lens | What our prototype demonstrates |
|---|---|
| Looks like | A black 3D-printed housing with an upper sugar storage compartment, cylindrical rotator, bottom outlet, separate joystick, and connected electronics |
| Works like | A full circular joystick gesture, detected through both X and Y axes, triggers a 180-degree servo rotation to release one sugar cube |
| Acts like | The user places a cup below the outlet, rotates the joystick in a full circle to request a cube, then releases it back to center before the next serving |

#### Iteration From Part 1

The initial sketch used a cup sensor and a timed gate. We first changed the gate to a rotating mechanism because a timed opening could release zero, one, or several cubes depending on how the cubes were stacked. We then changed the input from automatic cup detection to a joystick circle. This makes the interaction more intentional and gives the user an active role in serving the sugar. The final design therefore connects a recognizable two-axis gesture to a clear physical result.
